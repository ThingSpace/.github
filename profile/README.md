# 👋 Welcome to A Thing

**A Thing** is a platform for honest expression a space to vent, reflect, and speak freely without judgment.

We build open-source tools that support mental health, emotional expression, and quiet rebellion against the pressure to stay silent.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

We believe everyone deserves a place to say what they’re really thinking especially when they feel like they can’t say it anywhere else.

Whether it’s a midnight vent, a quiet journal entry, or something you’ve been holding in for years A Thing is here to hold it with you.
