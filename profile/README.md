# 👋 Welcome to A Thing

**A Thing** is a platform for honest expression a space to vent, reflect, and speak freely without judgment.

We build open source tools that support mental health, emotional expression, and quiet rebellion against the pressure to stay silent.


##💡 What We’re Building
- :athing: [**Mellow**](<https://mellow.athing.space>): an AI-powered mental health companion that lives right inside Discord.
- :pencil: [**A Thing App**](<https://github.com/ThingSpace/TheThing>): A journaling and note writing platform that lets you share your thoughts anonymously or privately.
- :electric_plug: [**Thingy**](<https://github.com/ThingSpace/Thingy>): A developer friendly Mod Tool to power note taking, journaling, and expression driven apps.
- :speech_balloon:[**Thing Talk**](<https://github.com/ThingSpace/ThingTalk>): A safe, AI powered space for mental health support and self-expression.
- :globe_with_meridians: [**Live Site**](<https://athing.space>): Try it out. Write something. Let it go.


## 🧠 Why This Matters

We believe everyone deserves a place to say what they’re really thinking especially when they feel like they can’t say it anywhere else.

Whether it’s a midnight vent, a quiet journal entry, or something you’ve been holding in for years A Thing is here to hold it with you.
